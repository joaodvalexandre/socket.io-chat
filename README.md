# Socket.io Chat Room
Simple chat room made using Socket.io

# What is required
Node.js

# How to start the project
Firstly, we need to clone the project, then using bash, run the command
```
npm install
```

Once the installation is completed, we can run the following command to initiate the server
```
node index.js
```

Then, we can start the fun of talking with other people by accessing `localhost:3000`

# In case there might occur an error
Try changing the port inside the document `index.js` to another one (Default: 3000)
